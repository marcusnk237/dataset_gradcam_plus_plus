# dataset_gradcam_plus_plus

Grad-CAM ++ Algorithms which gives a better  Visual Explainations for the decisions made by Deep Learning Model Using Tesorflow-2. However, the explanation is give at local level. Our library give a dataset level explanability. 
For bigger dataset (>5000) , we recommand to split the dataset into numerous batchs of 5000 samples.
